## Arrays

# 1.Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
5
9 3 6 2 0
```


### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
0 2 3 6 9
```

# 2.Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
5
9 3 6 2 0
```


### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
0 2 3 6 9
```

#3. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
5
9 3 6 2 0
```


### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
0 2 3 6 9
```
