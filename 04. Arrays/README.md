## Arrays

# 1.Linear Search

Given a random integer array A and an element x. You need to search this element x in the given array using linear search. Return the index of element in the input.
Linear search means, we need to compare elements from the array A one by one with the element x, till we found the match or we reach the end of array. If match found, return its index, and if not return -1.
