# 4.Nth Fibonacci Number

Nth term of fibonacci series F(n) is calculated using following formula -
    ```F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) ```
Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number. Also F(1) = F(2) = 1.

# 5.All Prime Numbers

Given an integer N, print all the prime numbers that lies in between 2 to N (both inclusive).
Print the prime numbers in different lines.

# 6.Count Characters

Write a program to count and print the total number of characters (lowercase english alphabets only), digits (0 to 9) and white spaces (single space, tab i.e. '\t' and newline i.e. '\n') entered till '$'.
That is, input will be a stream of characters and you need to consider all the characters which are entered till '$'.
Print count of characters, count of digits and count of white spaces respectively (separated by space).

# 7.Terms of AP

Write a program to print first x terms of the series 3N + 2 which are not multiples of 4.

# 8.Reverse of a number

Write a program to generate the reverse of a given number N. Print the corresponding reverse number.

Sample Output 1 :
```

# 9.Binary to decimal

Given a binary number as an integer N, convert it into decimal and print.
Sample Input 1 :
```
1100
```
Sample Output 1 :
```
12
```

# 10.Decimal to Binary

Given a decimal number (integer N), convert it into binary and print.
The binary number should be in the form of an integer.
Note : The given input number could be large, so the corresponding binary number can exceed the integer range. So take the answer as long.

Sample Input 1 :
```
111
```
Sample Output 1 :
```
7
```
# 11.Square Root (Integral)

Given a number N, find its square root. You need to find and print only the integral part of square root of N.
For eg. if number given is 18, answer is 4.

# 12.Check Number sequence

You are given S a sequence of n integers i.e. S = s1, s2, ..., sn. Compute if it is possible to split S into two parts : s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, â€¦.., sn (0 <= i <= n) in such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.
That is, in the sequence if numbers are decreasing, they can start increase at one point. And once number starts increasing, they cannot decrease at any point further.
Sequence made up of only increasing numbers or only decreasing numbers is a valid sequence. So in both the cases, print true.
You just need to print true/false. No need to split the sequence.

# 13.Pyramid Number Pattern

Print the following pattern for the given number of rows.
Pattern for N = 4
```

  212
 32123
4321234
```

# 14.Number Star Pattern

Print the following pattern for given number of rows.
```
Sample Input :
   5
Sample Output :
1234554321
1234**4321
123****321
12******21
1********1
```

# 15.Second Largest

Take input a stream of n integer elements, find the second largest element present.
The given elements can contain duplicate elements as well. If only 0 or 1 element is given, the second largest should be INT_MIN ( - 2^31 ).

Sample Input 1 :
```
6
22 31 67 1 12 90
```
Sample Output 1 :
```
67
```
