## Strings
# 1.Check Palindrome

Given a String s, check it its palindrome. Return true if string is palindrome, else return false.
Palindrome strings are those, where string s and its reverse is exactly same.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abcdcba
```
### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
true 
```

# 2Replace Character

Given an input string S and two characters c1 and c2, you need to replace every occurrence of character c1 with character c2 in the given string.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abacd
a x
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
xbxcd
```

# 3. Trim Spaces

Given an input string S that contains multiple words, you need to remove all the spaces present in the input string.
There can be multiple spaces present after any word.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abc def g hi
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
abcdefghi
```
# 4.Reverse Word Wise

Reverse the given string word wise. That is, the last word in given string should come at 1st place, last second word at 2nd place and so on. Individual words should remain as it is.

 ### Sample Input :<br>
```
shreya sharma is a good girl
```
 ### Sample Output :
```
girl good a is sharma shreya
```

# 5. Push Zeros to end

Given a random integer array, push all the zeros that are present to end of the array. The respective order of other elements should remain same.
Change in the input array itself. You don't need to return or print elements. Don't use extra array.
### Sample Input :<br>

```
7
2 0 4 1 3 0 28
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
2 4 1 3 28 0 0
```

# 6.Rotate array

Given a random integer array of size n, write a function that rotates the given array by d elements (towards left)
### Sample Input :<br>

```
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
3 4 5 6 7 1 2
```
# 7.Second Largest in array

Given a random integer array of size n, find and return the second largest element present in the array.
If n <= 1 or all elements are same in the array, return -2147483648 i.e. -2^31.
### Sample Input :<br>

```
7
2 13 4 1 3 6 28
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
13
```
# 8.Sort 0 1 2

You are given an integer array containing only 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array using one scan only.
### Sample Input :<br>

```
7
0 1 2 0 2 0 1
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
0 0 0 1 1 2 2
```
# 9.Sum of two arrays

Two random integer arrays are given A1 and A2, in which numbers from 0 to 9 are present at every index (i.e. single digit integer is present at every index of both given arrays).
You need to find sum of both the input arrays (like we add two integers) and put the result in another array i.e. output array (output arrays should also contain only single digits at every index).
The size A1 & A2 can be different.
### Sample Input :<br>

```
3
6 2 4
3
7 5 6
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
1 3 8 0
```
