## Strings
# 1.Check Palindrome

Given a String s, check it its palindrome. Return true if string is palindrome, else return false.
Palindrome strings are those, where string s and its reverse is exactly same.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abcdcba
```
### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
true 
```

# 2Replace Character

Given an input string S and two characters c1 and c2, you need to replace every occurrence of character c1 with character c2 in the given string.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abacd
a x
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
xbxcd
```

# 3. Trim Spaces

Given an input string S that contains multiple words, you need to remove all the spaces present in the input string.
There can be multiple spaces present after any word.

 ### Sample Input :<br>

```
abc def g hi
```

### Sample Output :<br>
``` 
abcdefghi
```
# 4.Reverse Word Wise

Reverse the given string word wise. That is, the last word in given string should come at 1st place, last second word at 2nd place and so on. Individual words should remain as it is.

 ### Sample Input :<br>
```
shreya sharma is a good girl
```
 ### Sample Output :
```
girl good a is sharma shreya
```
# 5. Remove character

Given a string and a character x. Write a function to remove all occurrences of x character from the given string.

Reverse the given string word wise. That is, the last word in given string should come at 1st place, last second word at 2nd place and so on. Individual words should remain as it is.

 ### Sample Input :<br>
```
welcome to coding ninjas
o
```
 ### Sample Output :
```
welcme t cding ninjas
```
# 6. Compress the String

Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
For e.g. if a String has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

 ### Sample Input :<br>
```
aaabbcccdsaa
```
 ### Sample Output :
```
a3b2c3dsa2
```
# 7. Highest Occuring Character
Given a string, find and return the highest occurring character present in the given string.
If there are 2 characters in the input string with same frequency, return the character which comes first.
Note : Assume all the characters in the given string are lowercase.

 ### Sample Input :<br>
```
abdefgbabfba
```
 ### Sample Output :
```
b
```
